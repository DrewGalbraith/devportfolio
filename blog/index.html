            <h3>Fablehaven (1 - 5)</h3>
            <span class="education-date">Dec 2024 - Feb 2025</span>
            <h4>Brandon Mull</h4>
            <p>
                Just as good as when I was a kid, and it was fun to read it with my wife. It was something we both looked forward to every day.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="education-block">
            <h3>Throne of Glass</h3>
            <span class="education-date">Nov 2024</span>
            <h4>Sarah J Maas</h4>
            <p>
                This series came highly recommended. I read the first book and enjoyed it. I need to seek more books with female leads, I found the perspective refreshing. Overall, I'm moving away from violence though, so I opted not to coninue the series.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="education-block">
            <h3>Wheel of Time (0 - 14)</h3>
            <span class="education-date">Sept 2023 - Apr 2024</span>
            <h4>Robert Jordan (and Brandon Sanderson)</h4>
            <p>
                 I wanted a challenge. And I was well-rewarded. I love the complexity that can come into a world when you give it 15 books to grow. I love that key characters died. That nations rose and fell. That no one person was 'the hero.' That said, I want a rewrite that doesn't talk so much about the dresses women wear and how sheer/lowcut they are, or that AWFUL line about women folding their arms beneathe their breasts; my guy, that's where everyone folds their arms! Ugh the objectification is palpable.

        <div class="education-block">
            <h3>Prophets See Around Corners</h3>
            <span class="education-date">Dates Read</span>
            <h4>Sheri Dew</h4>
            <p>
                I respect Sheri Dew a lot. She's a strong woman leader and a person of faith. I appreciated her perspective about leadership in my church having worked so close with them.
            </p>

        <div class="education-block">
            <h3>Mistborn (1 - 3)</h3>
            <span class="education-date">Dates Read</span>
            <h4>Brandon Sanderson</h4>
            <p>
                This was a strong recommendation from friends. To be honest, I didn't love it. It was good enough. I like the first book best, and the rest were mildly interesting, but I just didn't care for the stiff romance nor the multiverse (cosmere) teases. The shape-shifting kandra, though? ✨Master magic design✨ Good job, Brandon.

        <div class="education-block">
            <h3>The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe | The Magician's Nephew</h3>
            <span class="education-date">Dates Read</span>
            <h4>C.S. Lewis</h4>
            <p>
                I wanted to revisit a 'classic' from my childhood and decided on this series. Overall, I found it too simple to really enjoy, and decided not to read the other 4 in the series, but it was entertaining regardless.

        <div class="education-block">
            <h3>The Count of Monte Cristo</h3>
            <span class="education-date">Dates Read</span>
            <h4>Alexandre Dumas (and Auguste Maquet?)</h4>
            <p>
                The book was phenomenal! While I couldn't follow the French history, I loved the political intruigue. I can't imagine what the unabridged version possibly contains at 3x the abridged version.

        <div class="education-block">
            <h3>Lord of the Rings 1 - 3</h3>
            <span class="education-date">Dates Read</span>
            <h4>J.R.R. Tolkein</h4>
            <p>
                I love these movies. I'd only read the Hobbit. My take on the book? If the scenery gets overwhelming or someone starts singing, skip ahead. Then, the books are amazing. There's so much (particularly in the 3rd book)
                that I wish I'd been able to see in movies.
